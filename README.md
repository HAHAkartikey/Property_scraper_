Assessment for Python Development Internship at Mobilicis India Private Limited:

In this assessment, candidates were tasked with demonstrating their proficiency in Python development, specifically focusing on data scraping using the Django web framework. The assessment aimed to evaluate candidates' abilities to design, implement, and schedule a web scraping script for property data from the 99acres website.

Key Assessment Components:
1. **Django Project Setup**: Candidates were expected to create a Django project and app to organize their scraping script.

2. **Data Model Creation**: Candidates were required to define a Django model for storing scraped property data, including fields for property name, cost, type, area, and links.

3. **Web Scraping Script**: Candidates were asked to develop a Python script for web scraping using libraries like Requests and BeautifulSoup. The script needed to extract essential property details from 99acres' property pages.

4. **Scheduling with Django Cron Job**: Candidates were evaluated on their ability to schedule the scraping script to run twice daily using Django's crontab management.

5. **MongoDB Integration**: Candidates were expected to integrate MongoDB as the database to store the scraped data, including configuring MongoDB connections and storing data in a structured manner.

6. **Testing and Manual Execution**: Candidates were encouraged to test their script manually and ensure that it scraped and stored data accurately.

The assessment aimed to assess candidates' proficiency in Python, Django, web scraping, database integration, and task scheduling. Successful candidates would have demonstrated their ability to create a functional data scraping system with Django and MongoDB.

Overall, the assessment provided candidates with an opportunity to showcase their practical development skills and their ability to solve real-world data acquisition challenges, which are valuable skills for a Python development internship at Mobilicis India Private Limited.
